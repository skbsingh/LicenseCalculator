# LicenseCalculator
Some applications from vendors are allowed to be installed on multiple computers per user with specific
restrictions. 
Each copy of the application allows the user to install the application on to two computers if at least one of them is a laptop. 
This program is used to calculate the number of licenses required by a company for a particular application.

Assumptions made are:
1. There is no unexpected situations such as empty values, computers with multiple users or computers that are both desktops and laptops.
2. Assuming one only laptop has free license provided user has atleast one license purchased. 
   Any laptops after that requires a license to be purchased
